# Developing with Cosmos
The Cosmos Content Management Platform, or "Cosmos," is an open source project with two repositories. The first is for the "Publisher." This is the web application that hosts or "publishes" your web content on the Internet. It is built lean, with only the code and logic needed to host the website.  No content editing or management happens here. This project is a "stock" Visual Studio ASP.NET Core web application with the [Cosmos Common NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/CDT.Cosmos.Cms.Common/) installed and configured.

You do not have to use the Publisher above. You can add the NuGet package above to your ASP.NET Core application. Essentially, this adds Cosmos publishing to your website. You can mix Cosmos with functionality from hundreds of thousands of packages available through [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).

This repository is the second repository.  It contains a Visual Studio solution with several projects--three of which are unit test projects, and a fourth produces the NuGet package used by the Publisher, and the remainder make up what is called the "Editor."

The "Editor" is where web content is created and managed. It is your tool to manage website "layouts" and it is where web pages are authored. Editor also is a file manager. Upload JavaScript, CSS, imagery, videos and other types of files using "Editor."  It also manages Redis cache and Content Distribution Network (CDN) updates.


## Developing with Publisher

Most people will build customizations using the publisher and/or Cosmos Common NuGet package.  It is with publisher that people can "mash up" the functionality it comes with, with their own creative works.

For developing with publisher, any IDE that can be used with ASP.NET (Core) will do.  Examples include Visual Studio Code, or Visual Studio Community or Professional or Enterprise Editions.


## Developing with Editor

If you would like to make contributions to the Editor certain things will be necessary to run the unit tests and work with the Telerik components.  


## Unit Testing Requirements

As of this writing, the Editor repository  has just over 100 unit tests contained in three projects.  These are designed to be run from Visual Studio. Any [edition (including the free Community Edition)](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/compare/) will work. As of this writing, we are using Visual Studio Enterprise, version 16.11.2.

You will also need access to database, Redis cache, blob storage, web application services in Azure and Amazon Web Services.  You will also need CDN and SendGrid resources from Microsoft Azure, and, an Akamai developer account.


### Cloud Resources

*IMPORTANT: Do not use a database, Redis cache or blob storage account for unit testing that is also being used for a website or for development. Conflicts or dataloss may occur.*

Here is a complete list of items needed to run all the unit tests:

* Amazon Web Services
  * Website Hosting
    * Amazon EC2, or
    * AWS Elastic Beanstalk
   * Storage
     * Amazon RDS for SQL Server
     * Simple Storage Service (S3)
    * AWS Secrets Manager

* Microsoft Azure
  * Website Hosting
    * App Services
  * Storage
    * Azure SQL Database
    * Storage Account
  * Communications
    * SendGrid Account
    * Azure CDN
   * Azure Key Vault

* Akamai
  * Akamai Developer Account


## Telerik Developer's License

Telerik sells *developer* licenses not *run time* licenses. That means any product created here using a *developer* license can be freely distributed to the public as a package.  Cosmos is distributed *for free* as Docker containers for both Editor and Publisher.

To develop with the Telerik components either use a [trial license](https://www.telerik.com/download) or purchase a [developer's license](https://www.telerik.com/purchase.aspx?filter=dotnet#individual-products)


## Unit Tests

*TIP: When setting up your unit test environment make sure your development computers can connect to the all your cloud resources.*

The three unit test projects use "secrets" to connect to cloud resources. This includes user account names and passwords, and other kinds of keys and connection information. Follow best practice when working in development and [store these secrets securely](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/app-secrets?view=aspnetcore-5.0&tabs=windows).

Secrets are usually stored as JSON files.  Here are examples of the format and syntax of each file:

### Unit Test Project: CDT.Akamai.Tests

This unit tests pulls information from a secret called "Akamai" stored in an Azure Vault--the connection to which is defined in the following JSON string.

```js
{
  // This is an example of the secrets.json file used for the Akami unit tests.
  "ClientId": "MY_CLIENT_ID",
  "Key": "MY_VAULT_KEY",
  "VaultUrl": "https://[MYVAULT].vault.azure.net/"
}
```

### Unit Test Project: CDT.Cosmos.BlobService.Tests

The blob servive and Cosmos common unit test share the same Azure Vault secret. You can create this secret using the Configuration Editor that comes with the "Editor."

To use the "Configuration Editor,"  install a Cosmos Editor without any configuration.  It will automatically go into "setup mode." From here you can open the Configuration Editor. It is in the form of a dialog "wizard" which steps you through screens to build your configuration.  When done, it allows you to copy the configuration--which you then "paste" into an Azure Vault secret. The secret name must match the one below in the "secrets.json" file.

```js
{
  // This is an example of the secrets.json file used with the Blob Service tests.
  "ClientId": "MY_CLIENT_ID",
  "Key": "MY_VAULT_KEY",
  "TenantId": "MY_TENANT_ID",
  "VaultUrl": "https://[MYVAULT].vault.azure.net/",
  "UseAzureVault": "true",
  "UseDefaultCredential": "false",
  "SecretName": "MY_SECRET_NAME"
}
```

### Unit Test Project: CDT.Cosmos.Cms.Common.Tests

The "secrets.json" used here is the same as above with the exception of a few added fields.  These fields are used for testing connections and functionality to the AWS Secrets Manager.

```js
{
  // This is an example of the secrets.json file used with the Blob Service tests.
  "ClientId": "MY_CLIENT_ID",
  "Key": "MY_VAULT_KEY",
  "TenantId": "MY_TENANT_ID",
  "VaultUrl": "https://[MYVAULT].vault.azure.net/",
  "UseAzureVault": "true",
  "UseDefaultCredential": "false",
  "SecretName": "MY_SECRET_NAME",
  "CosmosUseAwsSecretsMgr": "true",
  "CosmosAwsSecretsRegion": "AWS_REGION",
  "CosmosAwsKeyId": "MY_AWS_KEY_ID",
  "CosmosAwsSecretAccessKey": "MY_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY"
}
```
