## About Cosmos CMS

This Readme describes the current status of this project, why it was started, and how you can join the team. Help us by giving us a "star" or "watch" this project.

### Status

* Cosmos CMS began as a project within the [State of California's](https://www.ca.gov/) [California Department of Technology](https://cdt.ca.gov/), Office of Enterprise Technology from 2019 through 2021 and was built as a collaboration between it's DevOps and software engineering teams.
* Starting in December of 2021 management at the Department of Technology decided to make this project open-source.
* January 2022 this project officially "opened its doors" for business as an open-source project.
* In January of 2022 [Tek Yantra](https://tekyantra.com/) offered to sponsor this project and become a contributor.  Tek Yantra staff have been involved with this project from the begining.
* Collaboration between this project and staff from the California Department of Technology continues.
* [Product website](https://cosmos.moonrise.net/) launched.
* Now the project is in a phase where we are trying to grow our developer and user community.

### Why a CMS

This project began out of a need for a lean, high performance Content Management System that has the capacity to handle extremely high number of users and be highly available--capable of hosting a single website from both Azure and AWS with real-time content synchronization between the two.

Cosmos CMS hosted websites built for the State of California's fire response of 2019 through 2021 and COVID 19 response of 2020.

[Please see our blog article](https://cosmos.moonrise.net/blog) that describes the unique architecture of this system.

## Cosmos Repos

Three repositories are associated with this project:

* The [Cosmos](https://github.com/CosmosSoftware/Cosmos.Cms) repository contains the "Editor" and the "Publisher" and all the frameworks common to each.
* The "[Cosmos Publisher](https://github.com/CosmosSoftware/Cosmos.Cms.Publisher)" repository contains a stand alone "Publisher" website.
* [Open-source layouts](https://github.com/CosmosSoftware/Cosmos.Starter.Layouts) made ready for use with Cosmos CMS.

The publisher repository is a "stock" out of the box Visual Studio application. It is turned into a "Publisher" by adding and configuring the [Cosmos Common](https://www.nuget.org/packages/CDT.Cosmos.Cms.Common/) NuGet package.
